# InDrive Mobile UI Clone

## Overview
This project is a **frontend-only clone** of the **InDrive mobile app**, built using **React Native** (or any preferred mobile framework). The goal is to create a sleek, functional ride-hailing interface similar to the original app, with a focus on **smooth animations** and **modern design**.

## Features
The app has the following key screens and functionality:

### **Home Screen**:
- Displays fields for **Pickup Location** and **Destination**.
- A button labeled **“Find a Driver”** for the user to initiate the ride request process.
- Bottom navigation bar with options: **Ride**, **Services**, **Activity**, and **Profile**.

### **Address Search & Input**:
- A dynamic input field for selecting **Pickup Locations**.
- A list of previously entered locations with **scrollable options**.
- A field for the **Destination** input.

### **Smooth Navigation**:
- The app includes a fluid navigation system between different screens with **animated transitions**.

### **Visual Design**:
- Clean and modern UI with a **dark theme**, using **rounded input fields** and **flat icons** for a smooth experience.
- The top bar contains a **logo**, **notification icon**, and **profile icon**.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native (with Expo or standard CLI)
- **Navigation**: React Navigation for handling screen transitions
- **State Management**: Recoil or Redux Toolkit for scalable state management
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated 2, Lottie for advanced animations
